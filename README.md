# starred-repos
An Android app to view a user's starred repositories.

The project is somewhat another version of a project originally done by [arriolac](https://github.com/arriolac) as a means to explain how to use RxJava/RxAndroid.
The code written here is similar to his, but I tweaked parts of the code to be able to use OkHttp for network
requests unlike his where Retrofit was used. 

I did this because most of the projects/examples out there that explain network requests with 
RxJava/RxAndroid usually make use of Retrofit for requests.

You can find his example with Retrofit [here](https://github.com/arriolac/GitHubRxJava).
